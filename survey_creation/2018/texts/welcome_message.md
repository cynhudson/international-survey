The purpose of this survey is to collect information about people who develop the software that is used in research. We call these people [Research Software Engineers](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2016-11-17-not-so-brief-history-research-software-engineers) [(RSEs)](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2016-11-17-not-so-brief-history-research-software-engineers), but they exist under many job titles (from postdoctoral researcher to applications consultant, to bioinformatician).
